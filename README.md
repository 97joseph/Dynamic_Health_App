 Cornerstone healthcare application
 
 **Project Description**
 DYNAMIC HEALTH APP in IONIC FRAMEWORK

**Mission**
-To promote the habits of wellness and provide centered healthcare with excellence in quality ,service and access.

**Vision Statement**

The main objective is to develop a web-based software that increases awareness of factors and resources contributing to well-being. The application is dedicated to establishing and maintaining an environment that promotes general health by supporting the adoption of attitudes that contribute to positive well-being and providing information, activities and services designed to support healthy lifestyle choices. The 
application promotes a healthy lifestyle and vary from specialized activity tracking, sleep analysis, nutrition management, mindfulness to general wellness monitoring solutions. 

**Background Information**

The Dynamic Health App is a web-based application designed to help users keep track of healthy heart rates and blood pressure levels.
The user wears a band (apple or android product) that tracks the heartbeat and pulse levels.
The system will track and record heart rate, if it is too high or too low it automatically alerts the user. If the user does not respond to the application within 10 minutes, it contacts emergency services.
The application also has an alarm function for daily medications and will alert the user when it is time to take them.

**MARKET ANALYSIS**

When conducting the market analysis, we considered the following:
Target market
Market need
Competition

**TARGTET MARKET**

Persons suffering with hypertension or diabetes etc.
Anyone who wants to monitor their health and wellbeing
Doctors who would like to monitor their patients' records.
The app will be made available to anyone who is interested in an overall healthier lifestyle. 

**CONSUMER INFO**

A need for health and wellness apps is apparent, as both Android and Apple marketplaces have a limited selection.

There is a gap in the wellness sector and not everyone can keep up with daily visits to the doctor. 
The app thus is convenient to the people who are too busy to get checkups.
The application is also needed as some people cannot afford hypertension monitors.

During market analysis, we found some applications that would be main competitors. 

 “Map my Run By Under Armor”
 “HealthTap”
 “Freeletics”
 
Two of the three previously mentioned apps were rated best Fitness/Health of 2022 by Forbes.

The following are some of the weaknesses we will overcome with Dynamic Health:

Dynamic Health is different in that it contacts the nearest hospital when there are any abnormalities, guaranteeing the overall health and safety of our users. 
Dynamic health will be modified to help users with underlying conditions get extra care.
